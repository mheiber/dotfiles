A lot of this is outdated, but I figured I'd share it anyway.

Key tools:
- neovim with coc.nvim:
   - see [Approach to vim, with highlights and warnings](https://gist.github.com/mheiber/c5be4474a5a5356c767d5b87663aebb1). The message is that vim is probably not worth it, but to share some things that make vim seem efficient to me and are hard to find elsewhere.
- mosh
- tmux
- bp() and src() scripts: ./functions/README.md
